Working through a couple of coding examples from several different algorithm courses and books. This is all to better prepare myself for any future programming jobs that I may apply for. Use a variety of different languages, just to make sure I have some good understanding. The problem is that depending on where I work, the tech stack can be very different. 
1. Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/
2. Cracking the Coding Interview book problems. 
3. Common interview questions based on research.
